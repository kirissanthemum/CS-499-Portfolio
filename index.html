    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my CS499 Capstone Portfolio. This ePortfolio showcases all the areas where I've grown throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University. The areas I've significantly improved and can be seenthroughout my Enhacements include problem-solving strategies and commitment to provided functional and secure applications. Each enhancement reflects a specific area throughout the computer science degree in which I've grown including Software Engineering and Design, Algorithms and Data Strucures, as well as Databases.</p>

  <!-- Initial Plans Section -->
  <section id="initial-plans">
    <h2>Initial Plans</h2>
    <p>At the start of my Capstone Course I was tasked with selecting my original artifacts to enhancement according to the course outcomes.</p>
    <p>For Enhancement One:</p>
    <p>For my first enhancement I will be revisiting CS 330- Computational Graphics and Visualization. The artifact I selected is a 3D graphics scene developed using OpenGL, originally created as a basic rendering environment with simple geometric shapes and lighting. Its origin lies in an introductory graphics project designed to demonstrate foundational rendering techniques. As part of my enhancement, I’m expanding the scene’s complexity by integrating advanced features such as textured surfaces, complex shape modeling, labeled visual elements, and shadows. These additions transform the project from a simple demonstration into a more complex rendering that reflects key software engineering principles like iterative development and design. </p>
    <p>The enhancement process will begin with rendering the original scene to assess potential areas for improvement. Subsequently, new 3D shapes will be created and integrated into the scene. Throughout the process, continuous testing and validation will ensure the development of a functional and accurate environment. The scene will then incorporate colors, textures, and product labels, followed by updates to the lighting to achieve a more dynamic and realistic appearance. Necessary adjustments will be made to object translations, and a new fake shadow feature will be added behind the objects. A final round of testing and validation will be conducted to ensure all features are functioning correctly. Once debugging is complete and all elements are verified, the scene will be finalized and upgraded accordingly. </p>
    <p>I will demonstrate skills in designing and implementing a modular 3D rendering system using OpenGL, applying algorithmic principles such as translation and graphics techniques to enhance visual realism with shadows and textures. I’ll utilize this enhancement to display my proficiency in using innovative techniques and skills to deliver a more valuable 3D scene. </p>
    <p>My enhancement will align the most with the course outcome: “Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.” Through expanding my OpenGL scene to include additional features such as updated lighting, textures, and fake shadows I will be applying algorithmic thinking and graphics programming standards to solve a visual rendering problem. I will also be making deliberate design decisions like choosing fake shadows over the more complicated shadow mapping feature within OpenGL. The fake shadows will balance a sense of realism within the scene to overall program performance. This decision reflects thoughtful trade-off management. </p>

    <p>For Enhancement Two:</p>
    <p>For my second enhancement, I will focus on Project One from CS 320- Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. This assignment utilized programming principles which focused on developing a backend service to manage appointments, tasks, and contacts and utilizing JUnit testing to ensure compliant functionality within the program.  </p>
    <p>To enhance this artifact, I will begin by running and testing it to initially identify any functional issues or syntax errors. Addressing these errors through iterative debugging will ensure the program operates correctly to start with. Once stable, I will implement targeted enhancements including updating setter method tests in the Appointment classes to ensure accurate data handling, add character boundary tests to validate input limits, and introduce null appointment handling to prevent runtime errors. Next, I will strengthen the Contact classes by adding update failure tests, then enforce immutability for task IDs to maintain data integrity. Finally, I will then refine in-line comments to improve code readability and maintainability. After these enhancements, a final test to confirm the program is fully functional and error-free before deployment will be performed.</p> 
    <p>To support the course objective of fostering a security-oriented mindset, I will demonstrate competencies such as implementing defensive programming techniques through null handling and boundary testing, ensuring data integrity by making task identifiers immutable, and utilizing error detection methods like update failure checks. These practices help identify potential vulnerabilities, prevent exploitation, and promote the development of secure and reliable software solutions. </p>
    <p>By implementing null appointment handling, detecting update failures, and enforcing immutability of task IDs, I will strengthen my approach with a focus on security best practices. These enhancements directly support the course outcome: “Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.” They contribute to safeguarding the system against common threats and enhance the reliability of data interactions. Additionally, I will improve the clarity of my inline comments and organize the enhancement process to ensure transparency and ease of understanding. This aligns with the outcome: “Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.” Clear documentation and structured testing facilitate better accessibility of the codebase, fostering meaningful collaboration and informed contributions from a broader range of stakeholders. </p>
