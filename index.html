  <!-- Initial Plans Section -->
  <section id="initial-plans">
    <h2>Initial Plans</h2>
    <p>At the start of my Capstone Course I was tasked with selecting my original artifacts to enhancement according to the course outcomes.</p>
    <p>For Enhancement One:</p>
    <p>For my first enhancement I will be revisiting CS 330- Computational Graphics and Visualization. The artifact I selected is a 3D graphics scene developed using OpenGL, originally created as a basic rendering environment with simple geometric shapes and lighting. Its origin lies in an introductory graphics project designed to demonstrate foundational rendering techniques. As part of my enhancement, I’m expanding the scene’s complexity by integrating advanced features such as textured surfaces, complex shape modeling, labeled visual elements, and shadows. These additions transform the project from a simple demonstration into a more complex rendering that reflects key software engineering principles like iterative development and design. </p>
    <p>The enhancement process will begin with rendering the original scene to assess potential areas for improvement. Subsequently, new 3D shapes will be created and integrated into the scene. Throughout the process, continuous testing and validation will ensure the development of a functional and accurate environment. The scene will then incorporate colors, textures, and product labels, followed by updates to the lighting to achieve a more dynamic and realistic appearance. Necessary adjustments will be made to object translations, and a new fake shadow feature will be added behind the objects. A final round of testing and validation will be conducted to ensure all features are functioning correctly. Once debugging is complete and all elements are verified, the scene will be finalized and upgraded accordingly. </p>
    <p>I will demonstrate skills in designing and implementing a modular 3D rendering system using OpenGL, applying algorithmic principles such as translation and graphics techniques to enhance visual realism with shadows and textures. I’ll utilize this enhancement to display my proficiency in using innovative techniques and skills to deliver a more valuable 3D scene. </p>
    <p>My enhancement will align the most with the course outcome: “Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.” Through expanding my OpenGL scene to include additional features such as updated lighting, textures, and fake shadows I will be applying algorithmic thinking and graphics programming standards to solve a visual rendering problem. I will also be making deliberate design decisions like choosing fake shadows over the more complicated shadow mapping feature within OpenGL. The fake shadows will balance a sense of realism within the scene to overall program performance. This decision reflects thoughtful trade-off management. </p>

    <p>For Enhancement Two:</p>
    <p>For my second enhancement, I will focus on Project One from CS 320- Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. This assignment utilized programming principles which focused on developing a backend service to manage appointments, tasks, and contacts and utilizing JUnit testing to ensure compliant functionality within the program.  </p>
    <p>To enhance this artifact, I will begin by running and testing it to initially identify any functional issues or syntax errors. Addressing these errors through iterative debugging will ensure the program operates correctly to start with. Once stable, I will implement targeted enhancements including updating setter method tests in the Appointment classes to ensure accurate data handling, add character boundary tests to validate input limits, and introduce null appointment handling to prevent runtime errors. Next, I will strengthen the Contact classes by adding update failure tests, then enforce immutability for task IDs to maintain data integrity. Finally, I will then refine in-line comments to improve code readability and maintainability. After these enhancements, a final test to confirm the program is fully functional and error-free before deployment will be performed.</p> 
    <p>To support the course objective of fostering a security-oriented mindset, I will demonstrate competencies such as implementing defensive programming techniques through null handling and boundary testing, ensuring data integrity by making task identifiers immutable, and utilizing error detection methods like update failure checks. These practices help identify potential vulnerabilities, prevent exploitation, and promote the development of secure and reliable software solutions. </p>
    <p>By implementing null appointment handling, detecting update failures, and enforcing immutability of task IDs, I will strengthen my approach with a focus on security best practices. These enhancements directly support the course outcome: “Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.” They contribute to safeguarding the system against common threats and enhance the reliability of data interactions. Additionally, I will improve the clarity of my inline comments and organize the enhancement process to ensure transparency and ease of understanding. This aligns with the outcome: “Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.” Clear documentation and structured testing facilitate better accessibility of the codebase, fostering meaningful collaboration and informed contributions from a broader range of stakeholders. </p>

    <p>For Enhancement Three:</p>
    <p>For Enhancement Three within my ePortfolio I chose and that was previously made in March 2025 as part of the final project for the course CS 340. The original dashboard involved a simple connection to MongoDB to access and analyze a csv file named aac_shelter_outcomes. For this planned enhancement, I wanted to allow the dashboard to securely retrieve and display data from a MongoDB database via structured JSON responses and include a RESTful API built with Flask. </p>
    <p>To improve the project, I will develop a RESTful API using Flask that encapsulates the existing AnimalShelter CRUD class. The process will begin with reviewing the current methods, followed by setting up a Flask application with endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting animal records. Each endpoint will handle HTTP requests, invoke the corresponding CRUD methods, and return responses in JSON format. I will conduct testing of the API using tools such as Postman, implement input validation to ensure data integrity and security, and document the API to facilitate future use.</p>
    <p>By developing a RESTful API using Flask, I aim to show my proficiency in HTTP request handling and secure data practices. I will design endpoints that integrate with my existing CRUD operations which will allow external systems to interact with the MongoDB database containing the animal shelter data through JSON responses. Input validation will be implemented to ensure data integrity and reliability which will be very important to me as a aspiring Data or Business Analyst. I will utilize tools such as Postman to test and review the API. </p>
    <p>By enhancing my artifact with a RESTful API using Flask, I am able to “design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts” by documenting each endpoint clearly, structuring JSON responses for outside use, and organizing the codebase for better overall readability. Also, this enhancement will allow me to “demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals” by applying secure data handling and integration methods that reflect modern software development standards and support real-world needs. </p>

    <h2>Enhancement One</h2>
    <h3>Category One: Software Engineering and Design</h3>
    <p>Narrative:</p>
    <p>For Enhancement One in my ePortfolio for this Capstone Course in Computer Science, I selected a previous OpenGL 3D scene project from CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization, taken around December 2024. This artifact demonstrates my ability to translate real-world graphics into a three-dimensional environment. I chose this artifact for Enhancement One to highlight my proficiency in C++ programming, as well as my understanding of software design and engineering principles. The project involved building upon existing code, adjusting lighting, textures, and colors to improve functionality. Additionally, incorporating various shapes and lighting effects showcases my growth in software development and my knowledge of C++ as a programming language. </p>
    <p>While the artifact has been successfully rendered, there are still areas for improvement. Transitioning the project from a previous virtual environment at SNHU to my local system using Visual Studio requires extensive background work to ensure proper build and execution. This process involved configuring the environment and making necessary modifications to the codebase. During initial rendering, I encountered significant issues such as missing textures, overly dark lighting, and black shapes. I addressed these challenges by increasing overall scene lighting, enabling textures, and adjusting material properties to reflect correctly. I also added an additional shape to the scene to further demonstrate my ability to design and develop complex 3D environments. </p>
    <p>Currently, I believe I am progressing towards meeting the course outcomes, including the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve specific problems using appropriate algorithmic principles and standards, while managing trade-offs inherent in the design process. I have successfully incorporated additional lighting and objects into the scene. Moving forward, my goal is to create a more polished and fully functional render of the scene, eliminating remaining issues such as blacked-out shapes and inadequate lighting. </p>
    <p>The primary challenge I faced during this enhancement process was ensuring proper initial rendering of the 3D scene. A considerable amount of backend work was required to guarantee initial functionality. Through this experience, I learned the importance of debugging and continuous testing in software development and design, which are essential practices for preventing issues in the future </p>

Each of these classes has corresponding test classes to validate the original classes, and methods are correct and functional. </p>
    <p>I selected this artifact since it easily demonstrates my ability to apply techniques for enforcing data integrity through immutable objects, validating logic, as well as showing my skills with defensive programming through the use of testing. This artifact highlights my skills with creating comprehensive unit tests to not only detect correct data manipulation but also prevent unwanted data manipulation. Another skill displayed using this artifact is the ability to integrate boundary and null testing to prevent errors in the application. These skills assist in showcasing my understanding of algorithms and data structures through how the data is validated and protected throughout a system. </p>
    <p>Improvements made to this artifact include ensuring security through making taskID immutable, handling null appointments, as well as detecting failures within updating variables. Another improvement showcases in this enhancement included expanded on the many original test cases to cover a wider range of security risks such as invalid inputs and edge cases. I also ensured that I improved and updated my inline comments for a more professional and readable application. </p>
    <p>The course outcomes I had stated that would be met through this enhancement were indeed met. For the course outcome: “Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources,” I made taskID immutable which showcases my proficiency with ensuring validation through defensive coding strategies. For the second course outcome to be met through this enhancement, “Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science,” I ensured that the inline comments were organized and professional for better overall readability and accessibility.</p> 
    <p>Upon my reflection of this enhancement, I would agree that this artifact enhancement assisted with deepening my overall understanding of software design and ensuring security is throughout. I learned more in depth that utilizing final when creating a constructor can assist with immutability and security. The biggest challenge I faced throughout this enhancement would be utilizing the Java language. As a prospective Data Analyst, my primary experience lies in SQL and Python. I initially encountered challenges with Java during previous coursework. However, working on this project and conducting research to understand the syntax and its applications significantly enhanced my overall Java proficiency. </p>
