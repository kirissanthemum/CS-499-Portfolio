    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my CS499 Capstone Portfolio. This ePortfolio showcases all the areas where I've grown throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University. The areas I've significantly improved and can be seenthroughout my Enhacements include problem-solving strategies and commitment to provided functional and secure applications. Each enhancement reflects a specific area throughout the computer science degree in which I've grown including Software Engineering and Design, Algorithms and Data Strucures, as well as Databases.</p>

  <!-- Initial Plans Section -->
  <section id="initial-plans">
    <h2>Initial Plans</h2>
    <p>At the start of my Capstone Course I was tasked with selecting my original artifacts to enhancement according to the course outcomes.</p>
    <p>For Enhancement One:</p>
    <p>For my first enhancement I will be revisiting CS 330- Computational Graphics and Visualization. The artifact I selected is a 3D graphics scene developed using OpenGL, originally created as a basic rendering environment with simple geometric shapes and lighting. Its origin lies in an introductory graphics project designed to demonstrate foundational rendering techniques. As part of my enhancement, I’m expanding the scene’s complexity by integrating advanced features such as textured surfaces, complex shape modeling, labeled visual elements, and shadows. These additions transform the project from a simple demonstration into a more complex rendering that reflects key software engineering principles like iterative development and design. </p>
    <p>The enhancement process will begin with rendering the original scene to assess potential areas for improvement. Subsequently, new 3D shapes will be created and integrated into the scene. Throughout the process, continuous testing and validation will ensure the development of a functional and accurate environment. The scene will then incorporate colors, textures, and product labels, followed by updates to the lighting to achieve a more dynamic and realistic appearance. Necessary adjustments will be made to object translations, and a new fake shadow feature will be added behind the objects. A final round of testing and validation will be conducted to ensure all features are functioning correctly. Once debugging is complete and all elements are verified, the scene will be finalized and upgraded accordingly. </p>

  <!-- Enhancement One Section -->
  <section id="enhancement-one">
    <h2>Enhancement One</h2>
    <h3>Category One: Software Engineering and Design</h3>
    <p>This enhancement revisits a 3D graphics project originally built in OpenGL, showcasing my proficiency in C++ and software design. I improved lighting, textures, and object rendering while resolving environment compatibility issues, demonstrating my ability to debug and refine complex visual systems.</p>

  <!-- Enhancement Two Section -->
  <section id="enhancement-two">
    <h2>Enhancement Two</h2>
    <h3>Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
    <p>This enhancement focuses on secure software design through Java. I strengthened data integrity by making key fields immutable, expanded unit tests to cover edge cases, and improved inline documentation. It highlights my skills in defensive programming, validation logic, and test-driven development.</p>

  <!-- Enhancement Three Section -->
  <section id="enhancement-three">
    <h2>Enhancement Three</h2>
    <h3>Category Three: Databases</h3>
    <p>This enhancement transforms a basic MongoDB dashboard into a full-stack, stakeholder-ready application. I built a secure RESTful API using Flask, integrated interactive Dash visualizations, and ensured reliable data rendering across environments. It reflects my growth in full-stack development, API design, and data visualization.</p>
